SASL
====

Bindings to cyrus-SASL for node.js.
Made to implement XMPP, but can be used anywhere.

At the moment the only plan is to support the 4 basic Server Side SASL functions:
 * sasl_server_new
 * sasl_server_start
 * sasl_server_step
 * sasl_server_listmech

Since I do not currently require any other parts of the SASL API, they will not be implemented.
You are welcome to add them though, please notify me when you do, so that I can pull.

Depends on cyrus-sasl, usually called `libsasl` in Linux distributions.
